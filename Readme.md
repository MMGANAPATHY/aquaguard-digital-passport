💧 AquaGuard – Digital Water Passport

AquaGuard is a blockchain-based Digital Product Passport (DPP) system that ensures bottled water authenticity by enforcing on-chain physical constraints — bottles can only be created if verified purified water exists.

Built for a Blockchain Tech Hackathon using Polygon Amoy Testnet.

🚀 Problem Statement

Water fraud is a major issue — bottled water often lacks transparent proof of origin, purification, and volume tracking.

There is no simple way for a consumer to verify:

Where the water came from

Whether it was properly purified

If bottled volume exceeds treated volume

💡 Solution

AquaGuard introduces a Digital Water Passport using blockchain.

Core Idea:

No purified water → No bottle creation

The blockchain enforces this rule automatically.

Each bottle batch is linked to an immutable on-chain record that can be verified instantly using a QR code.

🧩 Key Features

🏭 Treatment Plant Registration

Records purified water volume on-chain

🏗 Bottling Factory Enforcement

Bottles can only be created if sufficient purified water exists

Prevents over-bottling and fraud

🔍 Consumer Verification

QR code opens a verification page

Anyone can verify authenticity without a wallet

⛓ Blockchain-Backed Proof

All data stored and verified on Polygon blockchain

No centralized database
